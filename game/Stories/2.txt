Tuesday - Day 2: The Unexpected Visitor
The sun had barely risen when I arrived at the training ground.
The aftermath of Monday's discussions still weighed on my mind.
I had a plan for the day.
A rigorous training schedule focusing on skill drills, but life had its own agenda.
As I was setting up the cones, a shadow fell across the pitch.
I looked up to see a familiar silhouette, one that made my heart skip a beat.
Chen Wei, a club legend, was walking towards me.
His unexpected presence brought back memories of the club's golden years.
Of moments where he made the impossible seem effortless.
"Manager!"
He greeted with his characteristic grin, extending a hand.
"I heard about the club's predicament.
Thought I'd drop by and see if I could help."
I was momentarily speechless, overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events.
Mr. Zhou, emerging from the shadows, cleared his throat.
"I invited him," he stated. "Thought you might need some extra motivation."
There was an unspoken challenge in his eyes.
Swallowing my surprise, I responded.
"It's an honor to have you here, Chen. Your presence itself is a boost to the team's morale."
The players started trickling in.
their expressions a mix of shock and awe at seeing the club's legend in flesh.
They gathered around, eager to hear from him.
