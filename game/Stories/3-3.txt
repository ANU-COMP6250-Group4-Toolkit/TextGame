Choice 3: "I'll handle this. You all continue training."

Motioning to my assistant coach to take over, I approached the media swarm. "Let's have it organized! One question at a time!" I declared, trying to bring some order to the chaos.

The barrage began, but I answered each question confidently, ensuring that the narrative was controlled. Some questions were tricky, attempting to corner me into revealing our strategy or confirming the stakes. But I deflected skillfully, focusing on our preparation, the team's spirit, and the legacy of the club.

In the distance, I could see my team training hard, unbothered by the media frenzy. I felt a pang of pride, though also a touch of isolation, shouldering this burden alone.

After what felt like hours, the media seemed satisfied, and I returned to the pitch. Mr. Zhou's words rang in my ears, and I hoped I had wielded the sword right.
