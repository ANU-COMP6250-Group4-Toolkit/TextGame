Wednesday - Day 3: Media Storm

The sun had barely risen, but already the training ground was buzzing with activity. However, this wasn't the usual rhythm of our training sessions; today, it was the hum of media vans, camera flashes, and reporters swarming like bees. As I stepped onto the pitch, I realized that word had gotten out about our do-or-die situation.

A mic was thrust in my face, "Coach! Are the rumors true? Is the club at the brink of dissolution?"

Another reporter chimed in, "What's your strategy for the upcoming games?"

I tried to navigate through the barrage of questions, maintaining my composure. Just then, my phone vibrated. A message from Mr. Zhou: "Handle this carefully. The world is watching. And remember, the media can be a double-edged sword."

His words echoed in my head as I contemplated my next move.
