"Trust our training. We've planned for contingencies."
Reassuring the team, I emphasized,
"Injuries are unfortunate, but we're prepared.
Remember our alternate strategies? Let’s activate Plan B."
A switch seemed to flip in the team.
They transitioned into the alternate strategy as if they’d been playing it for years.
It was a sight to behold, watching them morph and adapt, embodying the essence of a true team.
Later, a team huddle brought out personal stories of setbacks and comebacks.
It was a session of mutual respect and deepening camaraderie.
