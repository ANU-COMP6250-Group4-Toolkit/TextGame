"We'll handle this as a team. Let's address the media together."
Gathering my players, I signaled for a huddle.
"We face this together," I whispered.
They nodded in agreement.
As we approached the media, a united front, our captain spoke first.
"We're aware of the stakes. But our focus remains unwavering."
One by one, each player addressed the media,
sharing their commitment, their training, and their trust in each other.
I watched with pride, realizing that sometimes, vulnerability could be a strength.
By the end, there was a palpable shift in the air.
Some reporters seemed moved, others impressed, but the narrative had changed from desperation to determination.
However, the impromptu press conference took a toll on our training time.
As players dispersed, I couldn't help but wonder if it was worth the trade-off.
