Monday - Day 1: The Reality Check
The morning sunlight seeped into the locker room, casting a warm hue...
...but doing little to alleviate the gloom that had settled post-Sunday.
I could see it in the players' faces: a mix of disappointment, fatigue, and apprehension.
The weight of yesterday's meeting with Mr. Zhou bore down on me, the urgency evident.

"Everyone, gather around. We've got work to do."
Li Wei, our seasoned midfielder, spoke up
"Coach, we need a fresh perspective. We've been pushing ourselves, but the results just aren't showing."
I nodded, acknowledging the elephant in the room.
I could sense that merely repeating our old strategies wouldnâ€™t cut it.
We needed to revisit our approach, reignite the fire.
We had to face the reality head-on, but how?
