Choice 1A: "Let's review our previous games and analyze our mistakes."

Players moved hesitantly towards the large screen. The room darkened as I played back key moments from our past matches. There was an audible gasp as a missed goal flashed on screen, heads shaking in disbelief at a flawed defense maneuver.

"See this?" I pointed, pausing at a critical juncture. "We lost the ball here because of a lack of communication."

Xiao Yu, the young striker, looked pained. "That was my fault, Coach."

"It's not about blame," I replied. "It's about learning and adapting. Together."

The review was hard. Reliving past failures, pinpointing errors, feeling the sting all over again. But by the end of the session, there was a renewed sense of clarity.

As the lights came back on, Li Wei approached me. "Tough to watch, but necessary. Thanks, Coach."

My thoughts echoed his sentiment. This was just the first step, but it felt right.
