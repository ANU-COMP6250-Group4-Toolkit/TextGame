-= Ending: The Journey Begins - The Great Game =-
Two wins out of three games.
Not perfect, but undeniably a significant improvement.
As the final whistle blows, I can't help but feel a mix of pride and a tinge of regret.
We were so close to a clean sweep.

The first game had been a tactical masterclass.
"Remember our training. Trust your skills,"
I'd urged the team. And it worked. The game flowed smoothly, and we secured a comfortable win.
It felt like the perfect start.

In the second game, our camaraderie shone bright.
"We're a family," I reminded them.
Every player was there for the other, lifting each other up, cheering on every move.
It was a close game, but our bond saw us through.

The third game, however, was where our inexperience showed.
Despite my reassurances that I was proud of them, nerves got the better of some players.
Critical mistakes were made, leading to a narrow loss.
I could see the disappointment in their eyes as they trudged off the pitch.

Walking back to the locker room, I find Mr. Zhou waiting.
"Good effort," he remarks. "Not perfect, but it's a start."

I nod, contemplating the lessons we've learned.
"We'll come back stronger next time," I promise.
And deep down, I believe it. The journey has only just begun.
