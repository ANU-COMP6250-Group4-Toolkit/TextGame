Choice 1B: "We need an off-field bonding session. Team building!"

Murmurs of agreement spread through the team. "We're heading to the adventure park," I declared.

The change in scenery was palpable. As the team engaged in trust falls and rope courses, I saw walls coming down. Zhang Tao, usually reserved, was laughing heartily, helping teammates through obstacles.

During a break, Mr. Zhou made an unexpected appearance. "I see you're trying something different," he remarked with a hint of skepticism.

"Sometimes, Mr. Zhou," I replied, "we need to step out of our usual environment to see things clearly."

By the evening, there was a marked shift in team dynamics. Players chatted animatedly, sharing stories and aspirations, building connections.

In the bus ride back, Xiao Yu came over. "Today was different, Coach. I feel closer to the team than ever before."

His words warmed my heart. Perhaps this was the fresh start we needed.
