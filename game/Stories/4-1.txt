Choice 1:
"We visit Xiao Li as a team after training."

Making this choice would strengthen the bonds between the team members. After a brief huddle, I addressed the team, "We'll continue our session, but tonight, we're visiting Xiao Li as one unit."

The team responded positively, and the incident seemed to light a fire in them. They trained harder, pushing boundaries, but with a sense of unity that was palpable.

That evening, our visit to the hospital turned into an emotional affair. Seeing Xiao Li, cast on his foot but smiling at the sea of familiar faces, was a moving sight. We shared stories, laughed, and for those few hours, the weight of the upcoming match faded into the background.
