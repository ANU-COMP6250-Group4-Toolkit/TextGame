"Share with us your experience on handling pressure."
Chen Wei nodded, taking a deep breath.
"Pressure," he began, " is an inevitable part of our profession.
I remember the finals of '98, when we were trailing by two goals.
The weight of expectation, the fear of disappointment, it was crushing."
He paused, gazing at the young faces hanging onto his every word.
"But it was in that pressure, I found clarity.
It taught me the importance of trustâ€”trust in our training,
trust in each other, trust in our instincts.
Embrace the pressure, don't run from it."
As he spoke, I saw players nodding, some even wiping away tears.
The memory of our recent losses, combined with Chen Wei's insights, struck a chord.
His words resonated deeply, reminding us all why we were here.
