The sun was just peeking over the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and gold. The pitch was covered in a thin layer of morning dew, making the grass shimmer. It was a fresh start to what was supposed to be another intense day of training.

I arrived at the training ground early, wanting to get a head start on strategies for our upcoming match. As I set up the equipment, I was deep in thought. Every pass, every tackle, every shot at the goal was critical. But more than strategies, I wanted the team to feel confident, to trust each other, and to play with heart.

The players started trickling in, the sound of their laughter and chatter breaking my reverie. "Alright, everyone, gather around!" I called out, signaling the start of our session.

Training started off energetically. Passes were sharp, players moved with purpose, and there was a clear synergy on the field. As I watched from the sidelines, I couldnâ€™t help but feel proud. We had come a long way since that gloomy Sunday evening.

But then, the unexpected happened.

During a particularly intense drill, I saw Xiao Li, one of our star forwards, go down. At first, I thought he might have just tripped, but the grimace on his face said otherwise. As the medical team rushed onto the field, the other players crowded around, their faces etched with concern.

I hurried over, heart pounding. "What happened?" I asked our lead physiotherapist, Liu.

"It looks like a twisted ankle, but we'll need to take him to the hospital to be sure," Liu replied, carefully helping Xiao Li onto a stretcher.

The training ground fell silent, the weight of Xiao Li's injury bearing down on us. Our key player, possibly out for the crucial match. I could feel the eyes of the team on me, waiting for direction, for reassurance.

As Xiao Li was being taken away, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mr. Zhou: "Heard about the injury. How do we proceed?"
