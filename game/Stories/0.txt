I can still feel the sweat on the back of my neck as I made my way through the echoing hallways towards the club owner's office.
The weight of our recent losses, the low murmur of disappointment from the fans, and the pressure to turn things around pressed heavily on me.
The owner, Mr. Zhou, was seated behind his vast desk, a picture window behind him displaying the pitch where our dreams were both made and shattered.
"Come in," he said without looking up.
The light from the evening sun cast a silhouette around him, making him appear even more intimidating than usual.
"I heard the rumors," I began, "but I believeâ€”"
He raised a hand to silence me, finally meeting my eyes.
"You've always been passionate about this team, always believed in its potential.
But passion and belief don't win matches. Results do."
He paused, letting his words sink in.
"You have 5 days. Prepare the team for the next three games. Show me that we can bounce back, or you'll need to find another club."
The room felt colder, the weight of his words settling in.
I swallowed hard, thinking of the team, of our journey so far, of the challenges we've faced.
"I understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Zhou. We've had our challenges, but I believe in my team.
Give me these five days, and I promise, we will give our all."
Mr. Zhou leaned back in his chair, regarding me with an inscrutable expression.
"Five days," he repeated, tapping his desk for emphasis.
"Three games. I hope for the club's sake, and yours, that your belief translates to results this time."
As I exited his office, I could hear the distant echoes of our last match replaying in my mind.
The missed goals, the dwindling morale, the hopes dashed.
But among those echoes was also the sound of our fans cheering, the memories of our victories, and the fire of determination.
Walking back to the locker room, I decided to hold a team meeting.
If we were to face this storm, we would do it together. Each player, each staff member, each fan deserved nothing less.
Looking out at the pitch from the hallway, I whispered to myself,
"Five days. We can do this. For the team, for the fans, for the legacy of this club."
With that, I squared my shoulders and headed back to where my team awaited, ready to face the challenges ahead.
