-= Ending: The Silver Lining =-
Three games, three losses.
The weight of disappointment is palpable as the team walks off the field, heads hung low.
I feel a pang of regret, wondering if I could've made different choices.
The first game had been close.
"Trust your skills," I'd told them.
And while they played well, a last-minute goal from the opposition had sealed our fate.
In the second game, our spirit was evident.
"We're a family," I'd reminded them.
They played their hearts out, but luck wasn't on our side. Another narrow loss.
The third game was our final chance.
"Win or lose, I'm proud," I'd said, trying to lift their spirits.
They gave it their all, but it wasn't our day.
As I make my way to the locker room, Mr. Zhou's voice stops me.
"It didn't work out," he says simply. "But there's potential. It needs nurturing."
I nod, heart heavy.
"I've seen what this team can do," I reply.
"With the right guidance, they'll soar."
The journey had been tough, but the future still holds promise.
Even in defeat, there's a silver lining.
