Choice 3: "Talk to us about the essence of teamwork."

Chen Wei's face grew serious. "Football isn't an individual sport," he began. "A lone player, no matter how skilled, can't carry a team to victory. It's the combined effort, the understanding, the sacrifice, the collective dream that does." He pointed to the club's emblem. "That emblem represents our history, our legacy. Every time you step on that field, remember you're not just playing for yourself, but for everyone who has worn that jersey, for every fan that has cheered for us."

I felt a lump in my throat. His words were a reminder of our responsibility, our duty. The players, too, were visibly moved, their determination renewed.

As the session came to an end, I approached Mr. Zhou. "Thank you," I murmured, to which he simply nodded, his gaze fixed on the horizon. The battle was far from over, but with the spirit reignited, we were ready to face whatever came our way.
