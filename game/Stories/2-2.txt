"Can you demonstrate a few techniques that made you stand out?"
With a glint in his eye, Chen Wei moved to the center of the pitch.
"All right, gather around."
For the next half hour, he showcased some of his signature movesâ€”his famous feint.
The impeccable ball control, the curving free kick.
Players tried to replicate them, their laughter echoing across the field.
It felt like the old days, with Chen Wei once again leading the charge.
I leaned against a post, watching with pride.
This impromptu session wasn't just about techniques;
it was about reigniting the passion, the love for the game.
