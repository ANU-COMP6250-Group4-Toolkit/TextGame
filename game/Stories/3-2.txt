Shielding my eyes from the camera flashes, I blew the whistle. "Formation!" I bellowed. My players quickly fell into line, starting their drills. The noise from the reporters faded into the background as the thud of the ball, the synchronized shouts, and the rhythm of training took over.

The media, initially taken aback by our blatant disregard, soon got the message. Some left, while others took to filming our intense training session. I noticed Mr. Zhou watching from the stands, his face unreadable.

By the end of the day, we had managed a full session, but the unease remained. The unanswered questions, the whispers, the speculative stories â€“ they would undoubtedly gain momentum. I questioned if avoiding them had been the right choice.
