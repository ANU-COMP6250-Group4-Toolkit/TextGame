"We need to re-strategize, considering our remaining players."
The challenge was evident, but so was the opportunity.
I gathered the coaching staff and senior players, diving deep into discussions.
We analyzed our player stats, strengths, weaknesses, and developed a new formation, placing Zhang Wei.
A budding talent, in Xiao Li's position.
The team was initially skeptical.
But as they saw the logic and potential in the new strategy, they rallied behind the decision.
Training intensified, every player adapting to the new tactics, ensuring seamless coordination.
