-= Ending: The Journey Begins - The Great Achieve =-
One win in three games.
It's not the result I had hoped for, but it's a start.
The weight of the week, the pressure, the choices â€“ it all culminates in a sense of hope mixed with regret.
Our first game had been a disaster.
Despite emphasizing on skills, our players seemed nervous, making rookie mistakes.
The defeat stung, but it was a wake-up call.
The second game showed the spirit of the team.
"We're a family," I'd said, and the team took those words to heart.
Though we didn't win, the camaraderie was evident in every pass, every tackle.
It ended in a draw, but it felt like a moral victory.
The third game was where we found redemption.
I'd told them how proud I was, and they played with a newfound confidence.
The victory was sweet, a testament to our potential.
Mr. Zhou meets me as I head to the locker room.
"It's a start," he says, not unkindly. "There's potential here."
I nod, thinking of the journey ahead.
"We've planted the seeds," I reply.
"Now, we nurture them."
