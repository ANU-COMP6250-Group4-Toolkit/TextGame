Choice 1C: "I'm going to have one-on-one sessions. Let's talk about our feelings."

A wave of surprise swept through the room. Xiao Yu raised an eyebrow, "Feelings, Coach?"

"Trust me," I said. "It's time."

The sessions were revealing. Zhang Tao spoke of his anxiety, Li Wei discussed the pressure of being a senior player, and Xiao Yu shared his fear of letting the team down.

In the midst of the discussions, Mr. Zhou dropped by. Peeking in, he asked, "Everything okay?"

"We're breaking barriers, Mr. Zhou. Building trust."

He nodded, looking impressed. "Carry on then."

By evening, a burden seemed lifted. Players were more open, supportive, and understanding.

As the last session wrapped up, Zhang Tao approached. "Thank you, Coach. Today meant a lot."

I smiled. Sometimes, it's the little gestures that make the biggest difference.
