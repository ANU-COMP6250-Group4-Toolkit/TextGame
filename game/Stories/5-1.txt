Choice 1: "Remember our training. Trust your skills."

I took a step forward, catching their attention. "You've all trained hard, given your blood and sweat on this pitch," I began, voice steady. "Each of you is here because of your exceptional skills. Don't doubt them now. Tomorrow, when you're out there, trust in your training, trust in what you've learned, and above all, trust in yourselves."

I saw nods, a flicker of determination in their eyes. But I also sensed underlying doubts. Had I emphasized their skills too much? Would they become overconfident? In the quiet of the night, I would ponder these questions, hoping that I had struck the right chord.
